@dataclass
class RewardConfig(TrainingArguments):
	r"""
	Configuration class for the [`RewardTrainer`].

	Parameters:
	    max_length (`int` or `None`, *optional*, defaults to `1024`):
	        Maximum length of the sequences (prompt + completion) in the batch, filters out entries that exceed the
	        limit. This argument is required if you want to use the default data collator.
	    disable_dropout (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
	        Whether to disable dropout in the model.
	    dataset_num_proc (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
	        Number of processes to use for processing the dataset.
	    center_rewards_coefficient (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
	        Coefficient to incentivize the reward model to output mean-zero rewards.
	    remove_unused_columns (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
	        Whether to remove the columns that are not used by the model's forward pass. Can be `True` only if
	        the dataset is pretokenized.
